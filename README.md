Playing around with React and nested menu animations for small screens. See the demo [here](http://dev.benbrooks.net/react-menu-animations/).

To get up this up and running locally:
1. run `npm install` from inside the root directory to install dependencies
2. run `npm start` to start the local server and see the project

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
